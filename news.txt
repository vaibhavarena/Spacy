Both countries had held Brigade Commander-level talks on Tuesday in Chushul on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) following the latest confrontation which was triggered by the Chinese military’s “provocative movements” on the southern bank of Pangong lake. China’s attempt to change the status quo on the intervening night of August 29 and 30 was thwarted by Indian troops.
China has denied that it started the latest flare-up, with an embassy spokeswoman in New Delhi accusing Indian troops of trespassing across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) - the de facto border - and conducting "flagrant provocations".
India and China were earlier engaged in a confrontation on the northern bank of Pangong lake but it was for the first time that such an incident occurred on its southern bank.
